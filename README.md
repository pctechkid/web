# What is this repo?

libDrive is a Google Drive media library manager and indexer, similar to Plex, that organizes Google Drive media to offer an intuitive and user-friendly experience.

I decided to create this project to, of course, organize my Google Drive library, but also develop my coding skills, and learn JavaScript in the process.
